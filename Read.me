##Implementation Details
The MD5 algorithm consists of several key steps:

##Initialization
Four 32-bit variables (A, B, C, D) are initialized to specific constant values.

##Padding
The input message is padded to ensure its length is congruent to 448 modulo 512.

##Processing
The padded message is divided into 512-bit blocks.
Each block is processed through a series of operations.

##Finalization
After processing all blocks, the final hash value is computed by adding the values of A, B, C, and D together and converting them to a hexadecimal string.

##Key Functions
rotateLeft
Shifts the bits of a number to the left by a specified number of positions, wrapping around bits that overflow.

#add
Adds two 32-bit integers, ensuring that overflow is handled correctly.

f, g, h, i
Perform specific operations on the variables and words during each iteration of the main loop.

##How It Works
The calculateMD5 function takes a string input and converts it to bytes.
The input is padded according to MD5 specifications.
The padded input is processed in 64-byte chunks.
For each chunk, the updateBlock function applies the MD5 algorithm steps:
Divides the chunk into 16 words
Applies four rounds of transformations
Updates the hash state variables (A, B, C, D)
After processing all chunks, the final hash is calculated and converted to a hexadecimal string.
This implementation follows the MD5 specification closely, ensuring accurate and efficient hashing of input messages.
